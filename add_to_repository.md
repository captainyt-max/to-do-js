# How to Add All Files to a Git Repository

1. **Initialize a Git repository** (if you haven't already):
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to your project directory.
   - Run the command:
     ```sh
     git init
     ```

2. **Add all files to the staging area**:
   - Run the command:
     ```sh
     git add .
     ```

3. **Commit the changes**:
   - Run the command:
     ```sh
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     ```

After completing these steps, all files in your project directory will be added to the Git repository and committed with the message "Initial commit".
